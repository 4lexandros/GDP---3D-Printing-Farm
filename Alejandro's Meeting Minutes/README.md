* Tim's Gantt chart is now honest and takes into account our exam periods.
    * The holidays have also been accounted into the Gantt chart.

* Whenever I write a message on Teams that I want the team to be aware of I need to @3DPrintingFarm everyone so that they get a notification.

    * He should add the deadlines from the guidance.
* Danae suggested asking for the out of hours permission from Ara and Alex Toth.
* Danae suggested that we prepare for our week 4 presentation. In it we should show:
    * Lay out what stage we're at.
    * What we're doing.
    * Stakeholders.
    * GanttChart
    * What decissions we've made.
    * Vicky suggested: LOOK AT MARKING SCHEME and do a checklist presentation.
* Danae has made an online excel to prepare for our formative presentation session.

## SM Monday 14th October 2024
Vicky is absent due to an appointment

* We are GDP group 1!
* We have a week 4 or week 5 presentation on Friday where we will have to review our work with our examiner.
    * All of us should be available.
    * 10 minutes per person.
    * We have a lecture on the GDP this Wednesday were we should be given some info about the GDP review.
* Andrew Hamilton is going to give us a talk about stakeholders of our project at some point.
* Ara mentions again Open-Source options.
* Because we are not collecting personal information we should be able to call to ask for customer research insights.
* Ara clue: Prusa 3.5 and above versions have a pressure sensor in the nozzle that is used for self-calibration of the printer -> Because prusa's have open source sofware we could perhaps use this for defect detection.
* Mark scheme is of course the most important part of the GDP guidelines.
* Ara mentions once again making this system compatible with other types of printers (SLA, metal, etc.).
* Make a requirements list/table, to guide all of our decissions.
* One of the problems with a requirements table is that they focus a lot on the technical aspects, so make sure that we incorporate the good things about the design description (e.g. ergonomics, ethics etc).
* We can add our own templates and slides for how we choose to do things.
* If the whole system works and we prove that it works then we are in a good place.
* Remember that this is an iterative project and the final solution may not really be the final one.

**TO DO [COMPLETED]**
* ~~Meeting with A.Toth on Wednesday.~~
    * ~~Power requirements (sockets for printers and laptops!).~~
    * ~~Make sure that storage is secure.~~
* ~~Send team NASA document about how to make a good requirements document.~~
* ~~A Gantt Chart has to be done by next Monday~~
    * Gantt Chart is a living document and can change, so change it in the future whenever the need arises.
    * It should be our own group's plan.
    * Account for extra time in our Gantt chart since some processes could be affected by setbacks.
    * Do not get stuck! Keep the ball rolling.
    * Manufacturing and testing is the part that often goes wrong.
    * Give time for additional iteration after the final solution has been developed.
* ~~For deciding our project roles keep the hierarchy as flat as possible.~~
* ~~Tim wants to be in charge of the Gantt Chart.~~

* Ara mentioned the Halo assembly line video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQfc0VIRMk
    * We should make a reference to this video in our GDP video :D

    * We may need to do a health and risk assessment.

*   Find people and ask what they want.

*   If we ask stakeholders we need to make sure our research ethics are correct.

* Gary would like for us to contact externals but we need confirmation from him.
    * Don't look just at the UK, look at a wider or more global market.

*   Google scholar for research.
    * Bachelor's thesis from Finland documents a very similar project.

*   Ara wants us to use 3D experience.
    * He will send us invites to the license.

    * Send orders to the system.
    * System is able to assign tasks to printers including slicing and pre-printing tasks + turning on printers and checks.

    * Identify which points of a submitted print might fail and which ones are unlikely to fail.
    * Make this system as safe as possible.

# 3D Printing Farm GDP - Scientific Literature
**Alejandro Parra Pintado | GDP_2425 | University of Southampton | 2024-2025**

## About
The point of this literature reference document is to quickly provide an overview of the findings and research that has been conducted on the topic of 3D Printing Farms by the GDP_2425 group. A Findings section is provided directly after this section and is followed by a references list where the relevant scientific papers have been collected.

## Findings

1) Thesis by Monika Radaviciute documents a very similar project to GDP_2425. In it a 3D printing farm is developed for university use.
    * Octoprint https://octoprint.org/ was used as the management software that controlled the 3D printer farm.
        * Octoprint is open source so it can be used in a very versatile manner without having to increase any costs. Having open-source software be the management software is also attractive for the customer to allow for further customisation of their farm.
        * There is no risk of a future price increase in Octoprint software becuase its open source code.
        * Open source code means that this system could be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, so security around this system could be required to a higher standard.
    * Prusa Connect https://connect.prusa3d.com/ is another management option that comes with 3D Printing Farm support already integrated.
2) ALL3DP verified article on how to set-up a 3D printing farm for your own manufacturing business provides other management software options with a focus on reliability.
    * 3D Printer OS https://www.3dprinteros.com/3d-printer-farm-management-software
        * Well established solution that forseeably fulfils most automation requirements.
        * Commercial distribution is not free and there is a risk of price changes.
        * Software allows for easy creation of user accounts, setting of permissions, seamless job request and automatic allocation of print requests to farm server.
    * Print&go https://printandgo.tech/
        * Integrates Artificial Intelligence for automatic error detection.
        * Commercial distribution is a paid subscription service and there is a risk of price changes. Price increases in brackets depending on the number of printers the farm would handle -- Free trial offered.
    * Autofarm3D https://www.3dque.com/autofarm3d
        * Specifically designed for 3D printing farm enterprises.
        * Less transparent than the other services listed above.
        * Commercial distribution is not free and prices are available if requesting a quote; there is a risk of price changes in the future.
3) Thesis by Joshua Pearce that provides evidence on the effects open-source 3D printing could have from the time the paper was written (2013) onwards on organic cultivation farms.
    * Offers insight into a potential new market for our product -- Farmers.
    * Explains that a lot of the problems faced by farmers in countries with different economic
